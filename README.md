# SoftPhoneClickToCall
> ### An Acumatica customization allowing click-to-call functionality from **Business Accounts**, **Contacts**, **Customers**, and **Vendors**

This Acumatica customization adds a 'Call' button beside phone fields that allows you to dial the telephone number in a soft-phone application like Skype, Skype for Business, MS Teams, etc.

## To get this functionality:
1. Download the latest full package [here](https://github.com/beardedmogul/Acumatica-SoftPhoneClickToCall/releases/download/20r2/SoftPhoneClickToCall.zip) or individual customization projects below (or from [here](20r2/))
1. Upload to the 'Customization Projects' screen in Acumatica
1. Publish the customizations

## To use this functionality:
Open one of the customized screens and click the CALL button beside a non-empty phone field. You may be asked to confirm the action and/or choose your softphone application. Once you have done so, your softphone should open and possibly confirm that you would like to dial the number.

> Disclaimer: this has been tested with MS Teams, but it will work with any application designed to handle the TEL protocol.
