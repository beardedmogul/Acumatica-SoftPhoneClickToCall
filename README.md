# SoftPhoneClickToCall
An Acumatica customization allowing click-to-call from Customers, Vendors, Contacts, and Business Accounts

This Acumatica customization adds a button beside the telephone fields that will allow you to 'dial' the telephone number in a soft-phone application like Skype, Skype for Business, MS Teams, etc.

To use this customization, either:
* Download the entire branch as a zip and extract it to get the 'SoftPhoneClickToCall.zip' file and upload it to the 'Customization Projects' screen in Acumatica
* Download the 'SoftPhoneClickToCall' zip by itself and upload it to the 'Customization Projects' screen in Acumatica
